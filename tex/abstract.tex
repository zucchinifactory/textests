\section*{Abstract}
%
This article is about the experiment on coincidence spectroscopy as part of the \enquote{Fortgeschrittenenpraktikum}.
It is meant to give a practical introduction into the methods of scintillation detectors.
The theoretical processes of radioactive decay and the interaction of the resulting $\gamma$ rays with matter are tested experimentally.
The coincidence method is used to detect the correlation of photons emitted in certain decays.
