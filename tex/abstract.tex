\section*{Abstract}

The research focus of this report is computer-controlled acquisition and processing of data.
We address the issues of measuring the oscillation of a metal reed which is being driven by an external frequency generator.

Basic scientific principles provide the bases of the experimental methods, namely operating measurement instruments, scripting software LabVIEW, communication between computer and experiment devices as well as analyzing the data with curve fitting.
While the experiment's results are not of spectacular nature, its findings still strongly signify a confirmation of well-established methods in academic day-to-day work.

We conclude that - without raising much expenses - meaningful improvements, like switching from LabVIEW to Python for scripting, can easily be made as technology advances and therefore recommend constant revisiting of utilized methods.
